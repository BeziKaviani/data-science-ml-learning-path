A comprehensive, structured, and practical journey through the core and advanced concepts of Machine Learning and Data Science. This repository serves as my personal knowledge base, documenting my progress, code, and projects from foundational data manipulation to deploying production-ready ML systems.

## üó∫Ô∏è Learning Roadmap & Progress

The journey is structured into the following modules, to be completed sequentially:

| Module | Topics Covered | Status |
|:-------|:---------------|:-------|
| **01** | **Foundational Data Manipulation:** Mastery of NumPy & Pandas for efficient data handling. | ‚úÖ **In Progress** |
| **02** | **Descriptive Statistics:** Understanding data distributions, central tendency, and variability. | ‚åõ Planned |
| **03** | **Inferential Statistics & Hypothesis Testing:** Drawing conclusions from data and validating assumptions. | ‚åõ Planned |
| **04** | **Data Visualization & Storytelling:** Creating insightful plots and dashboards with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. | ‚åõ Planned |
| **05** | **Data Preprocessing & Wrangling:** Cleaning, normalization, encoding, and feature scaling for ML readiness. | ‚åõ Planned |
| **06** | **Basic Classification & Regression Algorithms:** Hands-on with Linear Models, K-NN, Decision Trees, and SVM. | ‚åõ Planned |
| **07** | **Advanced Supervised Learning:** Ensemble methods (Random Forest, GBM, XGBoost), Hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation. | ‚åõ Planned |
| **08** | **Unsupervised Learning:** Clustering algorithms like K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering. | ‚åõ Planned |
| **09** | **Outlier Detection:** Identifying and handling anomalies in datasets. | ‚åõ Planned |
| **10** | **Dimensionality Reduction:** Techniques like PCA and t-SNE for feature extraction and visualization. | ‚åõ Planned |
| **11** | **Deep Learning Fundamentals:** Introduction to Neural Networks, CNNs, and RNNs using TensorFlow/Keras. | ‚åõ Planned |
| **12** | **Advanced Deep Learning:** Transfer Learning, Autoencoders, and Introduction to Transformer architectures. | ‚åõ Planned |
| **13** | **ML Software Development:** Building, packaging, and distributing ML applications. | ‚åõ Planned |
| **14** | **MLOps Foundations:** Version control (Git), containerization (Docker), and cloud storage (S3) for ML. | ‚åõ Planned |
| **15** | **Data & Workflow Management:** Orchestrating end-to-end ML pipelines and managing data workflows. | ‚åõ Planned |

## üöÄ Current Focus: Module 01 - NumPy & Pandas

I am currently working through the first module, strengthening my foundation in:
-   **NumPy:** ND arrays, universal functions (ufuncs), indexing, slicing, broadcasting, and random sampling.
-   **Pandas:** DataFrames & Series, reading/writing data, data selection, handling missing data, groupby operations, and merging/joining datasets.

The code for this module can be found in the [`/01-numpy-pandas-foundations`](./01-numpy-pandas-foundations) directory.


## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Languages:** Python
*   **Core Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Scikit-Learn
