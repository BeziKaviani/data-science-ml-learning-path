A comprehensive, structured, and practical journey through the core and advanced concepts of Machine Learning and Data Science. This repository serves as my personal knowledge base, documenting my progress, code, and projects from foundational data manipulation to deploying production-ready ML systems.

## üó∫Ô∏è Learning Roadmap & Progress

The journey is structured into the following modules, to be completed sequentially:

| Module | Topics Covered | Status |
|:-------|:---------------|:-------|
| **01** | **Foundational Data Manipulation:** Mastery of NumPy & Pandas for efficient data handling. | ‚úÖ **Completed** |
| **02** | **Descriptive Statistics:** Understanding data distributions, central tendency, and variability. | ‚úÖ **Completed** |
| **03** | **Inferential Statistics & Hypothesis Testing:** Drawing conclusions from data and validating assumptions. | ‚úÖ **In Progress** |
| **04** | **Data Visualization & Storytelling:** Creating insightful plots and dashboards with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. | ‚åõ Planned |
| **05** | **Data Preprocessing & Wrangling:** Cleaning, normalization, encoding, and feature scaling for ML readiness. | ‚åõ Planned |
| **06** | **Basic Classification & Regression Algorithms:** Hands-on with Linear Models, K-NN, Decision Trees, and SVM. | ‚åõ Planned |
| **07** | **Advanced Supervised Learning:** Ensemble methods (Random Forest, GBM, XGBoost), Hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation. | ‚åõ Planned |
| **08** | **Unsupervised Learning:** Clustering algorithms like K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering. | ‚åõ Planned |
| **09** | **Outlier Detection:** Identifying and handling anomalies in datasets. | ‚åõ Planned |
| **10** | **Dimensionality Reduction:** Techniques like PCA and t-SNE for feature extraction and visualization. | ‚åõ Planned |
| **11** | **Deep Learning Fundamentals:** Introduction to Neural Networks, CNNs, and RNNs using TensorFlow/Keras. | ‚åõ Planned |
| **12** | **Advanced Deep Learning:** Transfer Learning, Autoencoders, and Introduction to Transformer architectures. | ‚åõ Planned |
| **13** | **ML Software Development:** Building, packaging, and distributing ML applications. | ‚åõ Planned |
| **14** | **MLOps Foundations:** Version control (Git), containerization (Docker), and cloud storage (S3) for ML. | ‚åõ Planned |
| **15** | **Data & Workflow Management:** Orchestrating end-to-end ML pipelines and managing data workflows. | ‚åõ Planned |

## üöÄ Current Focus: Module 03 - Inferential Statistics & Hypothesis Testing

I am currently working through the third module, diving deep into:

-   **Probability Distributions:** Normal, Binomial, Poisson distributions and their applications
-   **Central Limit Theorem:** Understanding sampling distributions and their importance
-   **Confidence Intervals:** Calculating and interpreting confidence intervals for means and proportions
-   **Hypothesis Testing:** Formulating null and alternative hypotheses, p-values, significance levels
-   **Statistical Tests:** T-tests, Chi-square tests, ANOVA, and their practical implementations
-   **Type I & Type II Errors:** Understanding error types and statistical power
-   **Practical Implementation:** Applying statistical inference using Python's SciPy and Statsmodels libraries

The code and analysis for this module can be found in the [`/03-inferential-statistics`](./03-inferential-statistics) directory.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BeziKaviani/data-science-ml-learning-path.git
    cd data-science-ml-learning-path
    ```

2.  **Install required dependencies:**
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment. You can install all required packages using the `requirements.txt` file provided in this repository:

    ```bash
    # Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

    # Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook/Lab:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    # or
    jupyter lab
    ```

4.  **Navigate through the chapters:**
    Start with the chapter folders and open the Jupyter notebooks to follow along with the code examples and exercises.

## üå± Purpose

This repository is built to:
*   **Learn by Doing:** Translate theoretical knowledge into practical code
*   **Build Publicly:** Showcase my structured learning path and progress to the community
*   **Create a Reference:** Develop a comprehensive resource I can refer back to
*   **Prepare for Production:** Bridge the gap between academic concepts and real-world ML application
